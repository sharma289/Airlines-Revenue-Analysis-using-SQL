# Airlines-Revenue-Analysis-using-SQL
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this data analysis project using SQL and Python libraries would be to investigate the reason of losses of an airlines company and identify the opportunities to increase its revenue and profitability for the airline.

1. Increase occupancy rate: By increasing the occupancy rate, we can boost the average profit earned per seat and mitigate the impact of the challenges we're facing.

2. Improve pricing strategy: We need to develop a pricing strategy that takes into account the changing market conditions and customer preferences to attract and retain customers.

3. Enhance customer experience: We need to focus on providing a seamless and convenient experience for our customers, from booking to arrival, to differentiate ourselves in a highly competitive industry and increase customer loyalty.
